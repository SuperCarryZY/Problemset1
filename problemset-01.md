# CMPS 6610 Problem Set 1

In this assignment, you will learn more about asymptotic notation, parallelism, functional languages, and algorithmic cost models. 

As with the recitations, your code implementations will go in `main.py`.
Please add your written answers to `answers.md` which you can convert to a PDF
using `convert.sh`. Alternatively, you may scan and upload written answers
to a file names `answers.pdf`.
  
1. **Asymptotic notation**

  - 1g. Consider the definition of "Little o" notation:
  
$g(n) \in o(f(n))$ means that for **every** positive constant $c$, there exists a constant $n_0$ such that $g(n) \le c \cdot f(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$. There is an analogous definition for "little omega" $\omega(f(n))$. The distinction between $o(f(n))$ and $O(f(n))$ is that the former requires the condition to be met for **every** $c$, not just for some $c$. For example, $10x \in o(x^2)$, but $10x^2 \notin o(x^2)$.  

.  

**Prove** that $o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$ is the empty set.

2. **SPARC to Python**

Consider the following SPARC code:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathit{foo}~x =   \\
~~~~\texttt{if}{}~~x \le 1~~\texttt{then}{}\\
~~~~~~~~x\\   
~~~~\texttt{else}\\
~~~~~~~~\texttt{let}{}~~(ra, rb) = (\mathit{foo}~(x-1))~~,~~(\mathit{foo}~(x-2))~~\texttt{in}{}\\  
~~~~~~~~~~~~ra + rb\\  
~~~~~~~~\texttt{end}{}.\\
\end{array}
$$ 

  - 2a. Translate this to Python code -- fill in the `def foo` method in `main.py`  

  - 2b. What does this function do, in your own words?

3. **Parallelism and recursion**

Consider the following function:  

```python
def longest_run(myarray, key)
   """
    Input:
      `myarray`: a list of ints
      `key`: an int
    Return:
      the longest continuous sequence of `key` in `myarray`
   """
```
E.g., `longest_run([2,12,12,8,12,12,12,0,12,1], 12) == 3`  
 
  - 3a. First, implement an iterative, sequential version of `longest_run` in `main.py`.  

  - 3b. What is the Work and Span of this implementation?

  - 3c. Next, implement a `longest_run_recursive`, a recursive, divide and conquer implementation. This is analogous to our implementation of `sum_list_recursive`. To do so, you will need to think about how to combine partial solutions from each recursive call. Make use of the provided class `Result`.   

  - 3d. What is the Work and Span of this recursive algorithm?

  - 3e. Assume that we parallelize in a similar way we did with `sum_list_recursive`. That is, each recursive call spawns a new thread. What is the Work and Span of this algorithm?
